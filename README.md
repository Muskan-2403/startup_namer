# Startup_Namer

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A simple app that generates an endless list of proposed names for a startup company. 
End users can select and unselect names, saving the best ones. 
Tapping the list icon in the upper right of the app bar navigates to a new page (called a route) 
    that lists only the favorited names.
